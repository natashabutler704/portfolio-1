62-125 is an introductory course in free-hand architectural drawing. Its central learning objective is building a capacity for visualizing three-dimensional space through hand-drawing. A parallel objective is fostering visual literacy: the ability to use line and tonal values to represent architectural space. Schedule and Content The course is taught in two three-week segments that alternate with the three-week segments of a parallel course Digital Media 1. It concludes with a final project that is shared with 48-100 Introduction to Architecture. The course has three themes that bridge over the two three-week segments. The first focuses on contour and cross contour to describe surface and space. At its completion, it addresses the appearance of architectural space in perspective. Exercises are inspired by the approach of Kimon Nicolaides, The Natural Way to Draw, to these same subjects. The second focuses on the projection of space using both freehand axonometric and perspective drawing. The third is centered on modeling surface and creating space by using tone. A sculptural approach adapted from Kimon Nicolaides is used and at the end applied to drawing architectural sections. This work is preparatory for the final project. </label>
